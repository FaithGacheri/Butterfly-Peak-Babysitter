# Project Name : Butterfly-peak-Babysitter

## Client side react application for a Baby-sitter app.

# Project Description:
● This app incorporates an admin user who can perform all the crud operations and on top
of that can add a caregiver to the site once validated and re-assign a caregiver upon client
request.
● Our clients, who in this case is a parent, can hire a caregiver from their nearest location.
● As such, once a parent fills up the hiring form they are able to see the caregivers available
near their location.
● We also incorporate a payment where clients can pay for services rendere

# Problem statement
Lately parents have had the need of babysitters who will take care of their kids when they are out
and about going to work,managing their businesses or running their errands.The time to drop off
or pick up their kids from daycare at times prove to be a challenge for most parents.

# Solution.
Build a web application that provides babysitting services to parents at their homes.Parents can
access a babysitter of their choice for a specified amount of time that they want at an affordable
fee.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
