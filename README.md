# Project Name : Butterfly-peak-Babysitter

## Client side react application for a Baby-sitter app.

# Project Description:
‚óè We developed a website which is a user-friendly nanny application that addresses the current gap in the nanny search process. The app should provide parents with a centralized platform to search for nannies based on location, experience and qualifications and to view detailed profiles of each nanny before making a decision.
